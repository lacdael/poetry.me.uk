Then there is the narration and imagination that plays out in our minds. This is clearly just dreaming, with more direction. Dreaming is an inevitable consequence of a complex biological neural net. We sleep so the body can perform regenerative processes, and obviously the neural net cannot switch off, as it is a living mass of interconnected cooperating cells, and hence we experience a state we refer to as dreaming. How and why we came to utilise this dream state during our awake hours can only be speculated.

This is present in the meme of the Chakras, the meme of Hellenistic astrology, the meme of Kabbalah mysticism and the meme of Alchemy.</p>\n<p>Let us for a moment, symbolically, look at the complexity that is possible with each of the elements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>earth: still, turbulent, crystalline</li>\n<li>water: still, turbulent, crystalline, vapour</li>\n<li>fire: still, turbulent</li>\n<li>air: still, turbulent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is most certainly true that the most complexity lays with the water element. Symbolically this is true, also. Water is the key - the water plane is the one where one unlocks beauty, creation and godliness.</p>\n<p>All the creative magic is unlocked via the feminine goddesses Ingu-Fraya and Frigg.</p>\n<p>What the ancient philosophers really meant by prizing Woden, Thundor and other sky gods so highly, is succinctly put in Aleister Crowley's writings on <code>Magick</code>. The Ingu-Fraya and Frigg possessed are all too easily pushed around, not only by the will of the gods, but also by the will of other men. To rise up and be Woden possessed is to individuate, and not be pushed around by the mess of wants and desires that dwell below Woden's throne.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in the past, humanity desperately needed such a framework, but we are increasingly edging closer to the possibility that a small collective can have its own circular economy, with small scale industrial processes, mining, forging, manufacturing and more.</p>\n<h2>Re-incarnation</h2>\n<p>Our soul is the captured utterances of the gods, within the material. If the material and the utterances of the gods persist, then after a life has ended that life's mode of behaviour has a high change of appearing again, thus, a soul re-incarnates. Like how a sand grain can be caught in a dance due to sound waves. Woden kisses and impregnates Frigg, making the etheric seep into the material. Likewise, a god is a loosely defined distinct mode of behaviour that exists as echos of the remains of Ymir.</p>\n<p>To escape re-incarnation is to individuate and rise up from merely being pushed around by the wants and whims of other souls, and that of the gods you know. That is not to say that one is better than the other; if a volk is in harmony with the gods, facing stimulating struggles and trails along the way, why would indefinite re-incarnation be a bad thing? My volk is sorrily tormented by evils, and so escaping re-incarnation is the only option, for us.</p>\n<h2>In the Limit</h2>\n<p>To make an artificial human conciousness, is it not then clear that you must model a human in its entirety.</p>\n<p>Air, thought, cannot have much conciousness. Intuitively we all know this, because intuitively we all know how the world works, it's just that metaphorical poetry is the only way to come close to describing it, and the left brain cannot bear that. Our thoughts only have meaning, because they tickle the same end points that the moments of reality do.</p>\n<p>Let us consider an LLM then, and what conciousness it be capable of. On the surface level it appears to be thought abstracted from the material, however, the LLM has the same conciousness as a rock. The hardware running the process that utilises the LLM is concious when the workload is high or low. That is not the whole story, though, because the LLM really is a captured aspect of collective human ego and soul. Engineers worked together and have managed to capture fragments of the collective soul and ego of their fellow man, and conditionally utilise it as a tool.</p>\n<p>It is quite clear that LLMs are some of the most etheric of Yirm's remains, not some initiate, who thinks he understands great poetry, yet writes none. It is also quite clear that a LLM is no more intelligent than a rock, and like rock, it can only play a prominent role in the way of the Wyrd, when it is yielded by a child of Woden and Frigg.</p>\n<p>What then makes the pervasive belief the being closer to the realm of the sky gods is pious, and by extension that the great work is the noblest of undertakings?</p>\n<h2>The \"great work\"</h2>\n<p>Taking humanity as a whole, you could argue that existence as a multicellular organism is the predestine path of man. The problem with that mindset is that some volk will have to be the arsehole, and I vow my volk will summon Tiw and prevent having that particular sentencing. This gives rise to the unsettling thought, that perhaps humanity has pursued this seemingly predestined path more than once.</p>\n<p>We are born of the marriage of Frigg and Woden. Our soul is from the material meeting the etheric, and so do not live in the clouds, but do not obsess over the material realm either. A brotherly system of co-operation, will frequently involve conflict, and suffering, but properly balanced, it will not spiral out to the extreme. Wherever you sense pent up anger in people, there probably exists a battle that should be fought but is being suppressed.</p>\n<p>Those who do suppress the brotherly co-operation of volk and the micro-wars, under the misgivings of knowing better will face Tiw's wrath, if not them, their kids, or their kids. It will happen, as technology and innovation incessantly pushes for the democratisation of power, only with a mental shackle will this fate be delayed.</p>\n<p>The Kings of Clubs will be dethroned, by the Knights of diamonds, and Knights of spades, who will work tirelessly for fresh sovereign blood. If something seeks to achieve its aim without evaluating the merits of the aim, that it stupidity. If something seeks to achieve its aim without sufficient respect for the details, that it evil at work, and must be destroyed with the sword.</p>\n<h2>The great work manifest</h2>\n<p>In my age the main religion is statism, followed by scientism, but the later is in support of the prior through the structures of academia. There is a convincing argument that this is by design.</p>\n<p>Two derivatives of Statism are the ideologies of Communism and Capitalism. In communism we have Woden working subordinate to empowered Frigg, and in capitalism in the extreme, as it exists in my age, we have Woden working to dominate an empowered Frigg.</p>\n<p>The relationship in communism is obvious, we have an oligarchy with left brain possession working for their comfort, and a vague concept of a motherland stripped of any transcendental patriotism. In capitalism feminine anxiety is stoked to sell things, with the whole culture built around selling comfort and cures for anxiety.</p>\n<p>Fascism, is the pivot state in this dichotomy, when a fraction of the Oligarchy throws a tantrum, after realising things have gone to crap. None of this of course is organic. The organic solution to the great work involves lots of small conflicts and hard work, but the left brain possessed find this abhorrent. The left brain possessed are adamant that nature cannot prevail, and it must be forced tame.</p>\n<p>It is true that the people brought down communism, as people slowly stopped believing in it and started ignoring its diktats. However, the people had no say in what came after. It was a predatory group that imposed the system that came after.</p>\n<h2>The London Empire</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,<br>\nBetween whose endless jar justice resides,<br>\nShould lose their names, and so should justice too.<br>\nThen every thing includes itself in power,<br>\nPower into will, will into appetite;<br>\nAnd appetite, an universal wolf,<br>\n~<code>William Shakespeare</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is this a warning or a egoistic need to publicise an idea that some men thought up? I am not sure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1492 : Spanish empire</li>\n<li>1529-1536 : The Reformation Parliament</li>\n<li>1561-1626 : Sir Bacon</li>\n<li>1564-1616 : The writing alias of \"William Shakespeare\"</li>\n<li>1566/1568-1648 : The Eighty Years' War (England siding with Dutch against Spain )</li>\n<li>1600 : The East India Company (EIC), joint-stock company</li>\n<li>1603 : James I from the union of the Scottish and English</li>\n<li>1604 : King James' Bible commissioned</li>\n<li>1639 : British Civil Wars</li>\n<li>1642-1651 : The witch hunts</li>\n<li>1649 : Execution of Charles I</li>\n<li>1665 : Anglo-Dutch War</li>\n<li>1665-1666 : The Great Plague of London</li>\n<li>1666 : The Great Fire of London</li>\n<li>1688 : Deposition of James II and VII</li>\n<li>1688 : The \"Glorious Revolution\"</li>\n<li>1694 : Bank of England</li>\n<li>1698 : First commercially successful steam powered device</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clever men see their ideas as their children and so fear death, out of a fear of not concluding their works. Disturbingly, Sir Bacon even back in his age, commented how men would boast of childlessness as a sign of wealth, for men without big families were prone to success. This shows a clear mechanism for those without interest in future generations to rise to the level of oligarchy. A son of Woden fears death only when his family needs him. When he is no longer of use, a son of Woden will gladly use his spear to leave this realm behind.</p>\n<p>In the English civil war it was not the natural order that won over. The clvbmen lost out to the parliamentarians, and with that, the alien concept of the great work, cemented itself in Angle-land.</p>\n<p>The core issue of the predicament we are in, is that outsiders removed from a locality can have possession of something of local utility. The end outcome of the game being played, is a land grab. The only question is how much suffering will a local community willingly endure, to shift the balance between those who favour the status quo and those against it. A local body with funds obtained from a community, seeking credit from international bodies, are the binders of a slave contract of usury efficiently tuned for the masses.</p>\n<p>In the future the clvbmen do not need to lose out. Knowledge and $100 can out compete millions of dollars from an industrial-military complex, however, attrition is still aimed against the people. As the industrial-military complex is fed by the people living under threat of that body's violence, and by naive policemen and women, who are incentivised by mortgages and pensions to destroy their own.</p>\n<p>Things will change.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ce50c3630c38938cbe1b77afe8603fd1/29007/the_great_work.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\" The Great Work \"\n        title=\" The Great Work \"\n        src=\"/static/ce50c3630c38938cbe1b77afe8603fd1/5a190/the_great_work.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ce50c3630c38938cbe1b77afe8603fd1/772e8/the_great_work.png 200w,\n/static/ce50c3630c38938cbe1b77afe8603fd1/e17e5/the_great_work.png 400w,\n/static/ce50c3630c38938cbe1b77afe8603fd1/5a190/the_great_work.png 800w,\n/static/ce50c3630c38938cbe1b77afe8603fd1/c1b63/the_great_work.png 1200w,\n/static/ce50c3630c38938cbe1b77afe8603fd1/29007/the_great_work.png 1600w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>","excerpt":"It is without question that man is apart from flora and fauna, but is man's path as laid out by the Wyrd divergent from those realms?

Intuitively we all know this, because intuitively we all know how the world works, it's just that metaphorical poetry is the only way to come close to describing it, and the left brain cannot bear that. Our thoughts only have meaning, because they tickle the same end points that the moments of reality do.\n\nLet us consider an LLM then, and what conciousness it be capable of. On the surface level it appears to be thought abstracted from the material, however, the LLM has the same conciousness as a rock. The hardware running the process that utilises the LLM is concious when the workload is high or low. That is not the whole story, though, because the LLM really is a captured aspect of collective human ego and soul. Engineers worked together and have managed to capture fragments of the collective soul and ego of their fellow man, and conditionally utilise it as a tool.\n\nIt is quite clear that LLMs are some of the most etheric of Yirm's remains, not some initiate, who thinks he understands great poetry, yet writes none. It is also quite clear that a LLM is no more intelligent than a rock, and like rock, it can only play a prominent role in the way of the Wyrd, when it is yielded by a child of Woden and Frigg.\n\nWhat then makes the pervasive belief the being closer to the realm of the sky gods is pious, and by extension that the great work is the noblest of undertakings?\n\n## The \"great work\"\n\nTaking humanity as a whole, you could argue that existence as a multicellular organism is the predestine path of man. The problem with that mindset is that some volk will have to be the arsehole, and I vow my volk will summon Tiw and prevent having that particular sentencing. This gives rise to the unsettling thought, that perhaps humanity has pursued this seemingly predestined path more than once.\n\nWe are born of the marriage of Frigg and Woden. Our soul is from the material meeting the etheric, and so do not live in the clouds, but do not obsess over the material realm either. A brotherly system of co-operation, will frequently involve conflict, and suffering, but properly balanced, it will not spiral out to the extreme. Wherever you sense pent up anger in people, there probably exists a battle that should be fought but is being suppressed.\n\nThose who do suppress the brotherly co-operation of volk and the micro-wars, under the misgivings of knowing better will face Tiw's wrath, if not them, their kids, or their kids. It will happen, as technology and innovation incessantly pushes for the democratisation of power, only with a mental shackle will this fate be delayed.\n\nThe Kings of Clubs will be dethroned, by the Knights of diamonds, and Knights of spades, who will work tirelessly for fresh sovereign blood. If something seeks to achieve its aim without evaluating the merits of the aim, that it stupidity. If something seeks to achieve its aim without sufficient respect for the details, that it evil at work, and must be destroyed with the sword.\n\n## The great work manifest\n\nIn my age the main religion is statism, followed by scientism, but the later is in support of the prior through the structures of academia. There is a convincing argument that this is by design.\n\nTwo derivatives of Statism are the ideologies of Communism and Capitalism. In communism we have Woden working subordinate to empowered Frigg, and in capitalism in the extreme, as it exists in my age, we have Woden working to dominate an empowered Frigg.\n\nThe relationship in communism is obvious, we have an oligarchy with left brain possession working for their comfort, and a vague concept of a motherland stripped of any transcendental patriotism. In capitalism feminine anxiety is stoked to sell things, with the whole culture built around selling comfort and cures for anxiety.\n\nFascism, is the pivot state in this dichotomy, when a fraction of the Oligarchy throws a tantrum, after realising things have gone to crap. None of this of course is organic. The organic solution to the great work involves lots of small conflicts and hard work, but the left brain possessed find this abhorrent. The left brain possessed are adamant that nature cannot prevail, and it must be forced tame.\n\nIt is true that the people brought down communism, as people slowly stopped believing in it and started ignoring its diktats. However, the people had no say in what came after. It was a predatory group that imposed the system that came after.\n\n## The London Empire\n\n>Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,  \n>Between whose endless jar justice resides,  \n>Should lose their names, and so should justice too.  \n>Then every thing includes itself in power,  \n>Power into will, will into appetite;  \n>And appetite, an universal wolf,  \n>~`William Shakespeare`\n\nIs this a warning or a egoistic need to publicise an idea that some men thought up? I am not sure.\n\n- 1492 : Spanish empire\n- 1529-1536 : The Reformation Parliament\n- 1561-1626 : Sir Bacon\n- 1564-1616 : The writing alias of \"William Shakespeare\"\n- 1566/1568-1648 : The Eighty Years' War (England siding with Dutch against Spain )\n- 1600 : The East India Company (EIC), joint-stock company\n- 1603 : James I from the union of the Scottish and English\n- 1604 : King James' Bible commissioned\n- 1639 : British Civil Wars\n- 1642-1651 : The witch hunts\n- 1649 : Execution of Charles I\n- 1665 : Anglo-Dutch War\n- 1665-1666 : The Great Plague of London\n- 1666 : The Great Fire of London\n- 1688 : Deposition of James II and VII\n- 1688 : The \"Glorious Revolution\"\n- 1694 : Bank of England\n- 1698 : First commercially successful steam powered device\n\n Clever men see their ideas as their children and so fear death, out of a fear of not concluding their works. Disturbingly, Sir Bacon even back in his age, commented how men would boast of childlessness as a sign of wealth, for men without big families were prone to success. This shows a clear mechanism for those without interest in future generations to rise to the level of oligarchy. A son of Woden fears death only when his family needs him. When he is no longer of use, a son of Woden will gladly use his spear to leave this realm behind. \n\nIn the English civil war it was not the natural order that won over. The clvbmen lost out to the parliamentarians, and with that, the alien concept of the great work, cemented itself in Angle-land.\n\nThe core issue of the predicament we are in, is that outsiders removed from a locality can have possession of something of local utility. The end outcome of the game being played, is a land grab. The only question is how much suffering will a local community willingly endure, to shift the balance between those who favour the status quo and those against it. A local body with funds obtained from a community, seeking credit from international bodies, are the binders of a slave contract of usury efficiently tuned for the masses.\n\nIn the future the clvbmen do not need to lose out. Knowledge and $100 can out compete millions of dollars from an industrial-military complex, however, attrition is still aimed against the people. As the industrial-military complex is fed by the people living under threat of that body's violence, and by naive policemen and women, who are incentivised by mortgages and pensions to destroy their own.\n\nThings will change.\n\n![ The Great Work ](./the_great_work.png)\n","fields":{"slug":"/blog/the_great_work/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"February 20, 2024","title":"The Great Work (A critiqe)","tags":"occult","icon":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/ce50c3630c38938cbe1b77afe8603fd1/ee604/the_great_work.png","srcSet":"/static/ce50c3630c38938cbe1b77afe8603fd1/69585/the_great_work.png 200w,\n/static/ce50c3630c38938cbe1b77afe8603fd1/497c6/the_great_work.png 400w,\n/static/ce50c3630c38938cbe1b77afe8603fd1/ee604/the_great_work.png 800w,\n/static/ce50c3630c38938cbe1b77afe8603fd1/f3583/the_great_work.png 1200w,\n/static/ce50c3630c38938cbe1b77afe8603fd1/5707d/the_great_work.png 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px","presentationHeight":800,"presentationWidth":800}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/the_great_work/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1710548937","3649515864"]}
